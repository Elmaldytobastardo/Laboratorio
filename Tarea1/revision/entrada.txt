His aim is to discover a learning procedure that is efficient at finding complex structure in large, high-dimensional datasets and to show that this is how the brain learns to see. He was one of the researchers who introduced the backpropagation algorithm and the first to use backpropagation for learning word embeddings. His other contributions to neural network research include Boltzmann machine or, distributed representations, time-delay neural nets, mixtures of experts, variational learning, products of experts and deep belief nets. classification.
